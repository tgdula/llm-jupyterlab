       "7. Integration with third-party tools: The tool can be integrated with third-party tools such as project management software, issue tracking systems, and customer relationship management (CRM) platforms, making it an all-in-one solution for businesses.\n",
       "8. Scalability: The Estimation tool is designed to be scalable, allowing users to grow their estimation processes as needed without compromising performance.\n",
       "9. Security: The tool has robust security features in place to protect sensitive information and ensure data privacy.\n",
       "10. Customizable workflows: Users can customize the workflows for the estimation process to suit their specific needs, ensuring that all stakeholders are involved in the estimation process from start to finish."
